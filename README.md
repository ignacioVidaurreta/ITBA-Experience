# ITBA-Experience
  ITBA Experience: Hell Week is an RPG styled game set in college (Specifically in Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Buenos Aires-ITBA) done for a college project. Our goal was to create a game in Java using the Object Oriented paradigm.

  The main character is a student trying to survive a week full of exams, in which they have to _fight_ against the professors
of each subject in order to pass them.

  The battle system is similar to the Final Fantasy saga, where a _party_ (the alumni) fights against another (professors) in a turned based fight. In each turn, every member of the party will be able to use one of his special abilities (if he has any).
